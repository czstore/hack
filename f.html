<h1>FAQ's</h1><br>
Q:What is Critical Ops?<br>
A:
Are you ready to delve into wildly intense gaming experience?

C-OPS is the FPS game that puts you in the center of enrapturing multiplayer action and lets you join the battle across an abundance of beautifully crafted maps and challenging game modes.

Critical Ops delivers brilliantly executed gameplay on both competitive and casual levels. Intelligent ranking pits you against the players that match your skill, with the option to go head-to-head or team up to tackle complex scenarios and situations.

Whether you play with friends or go at it alone, Critical Ops brings tons of blistering action and impacful thrills. The game is purely skill based, which means that it is not and never will be pay-to-win. Therefore, you can genuinely feel the excitement of victory when you earn new ranks.

The game currently is in Beta phase; Critical Ops is still under development, but you can download and play the game now. Regular updates improve game performance and introduce new game modes, features and unique weapon skins to personalize the experience for you as a player.<br><br>

Q:Where can I find Critical Ops?<br>
A:
You can download Critical Ops from Google Play store or from Amazon App Store for Android devices and from Apple App Store for iOS devices.<br><br>

Q:With what kind of a device can I play?<br>
A:
If you have an Android phone or tablet, your device must have OS Android 4.4 or more.

If you have an Apple device, it must have iOS 9.0 or more.

Your device’s RAM must be 1Gb or more. Please make sure you have enough free memory on your device.

If your device is incompatible or you can’t download the game properly even though your device meets these requirements, please take notice that our game does not support rooted or otherwise emulated devices.

If you have downloaded your game from some unauthorized source, it might not work properly. We only support downloads from authorized app stores.<br><br>

Q:Can I still play on PC?<br>
A:
The Gameroom version was permanently shut down on 10th July 2017. After a long and thorough consideration, we decided to focus on development of the mobile version of the game, since our main audience preferred it instead. We are a mobile game studio, thus our focus is and always will be on mobile online gaming and competitive eSports. We are aware that this may affect on some players’ opinions and feelings about Critical Ops. We are very sorry for the inconvenience and sincerely hope that you will enjoy our game on mobile!<br><br>
Q:There is a hacker in the game! What to do?<br>
A:
Making the game hack-proof requires a lot of effort. We are, however, developing a reliable anti-cheat system to keep the game hacker-free.

If you want to report a hacker, we need a proper video footage (at least 15 seconds in length) as proof of the offense that the user has committed. Screenshots alone are not reliable enough.

Upload your video to YouTube or Google Drive and send us the link to the video, so we can add the link of the video in the banned player’s profile, in case of appeals.

Please send the clip that you recorded to reportahacker@criticalforce.fi.<br><br>

Q:Can I have some skins, please?<br>
A:
We do not give cases, credits, skins or knives simply by request. However, we do case giveaways on our Community Live Stream on Thursdays at 18:00 GMT+3 / 5 PM CEST. Also, we run contests where you can win cases! Follow us on Twitter to never miss a contest.

The only other way to get skins is to open cases, or purchase them with blue credits.<br><br>

Q:Will you add voice chat in the game?<br>
A:Right now we are not planning to add this feature due to technical limitations on mobile devices.<br><br>
Q:Clan stolen or missing clan leader<br>
A:
If your clan has been stolen or scammed from you by another player, there is nothing we can currently do to help. Please do not hand over clan ownership to other players unless you are certain of their intentions. The clan can be upgraded by any player, you do not need to be the clan leader to do this.

If your clan leader is no longer playing the game or has lost access to their clan leader account, you will need to create a new clan to procure clan leader status.<br><br>
